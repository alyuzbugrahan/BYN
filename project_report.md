## Introduction

### Problem Definition

In today's digital era, professional networking has become crucial for career development and business growth. While platforms like LinkedIn exist, there is a need for understanding how such complex networking platforms are built and implemented. Many students and developers lack practical experience in building full-stack applications that handle user authentication, social features, and real-time interactions.

### Project Objective

The BYN (Build Your Network) platform aims to create a comprehensive professional networking web application inspired by LinkedIn. The primary objectives include:

- **Educational Purpose**: Demonstrate full-stack web development practices using modern technologies
- **User Management**: Implement secure user authentication and profile management
- **Professional Networking**: Enable users to build professional connections and manage their career profiles
- **Scalable Architecture**: Design a system that can handle multiple users and real-time interactions
- **API-First Approach**: Build a robust REST API that can serve multiple frontend applications

### Project Scope

The current implementation (Phase 1) focuses on core user management features including registration, authentication, profile management, and basic networking capabilities. Future phases will expand to include job postings, social feeds, and advanced networking features.

## Software Architecture

### System Architecture Overview

The BYN platform follows a modern three-tier architecture with clear separation of concerns as illustrated in Fig.1 below. The system is designed using microservices principles with containerized deployment.

#### Architecture Components

1. **Frontend Layer (Presentation Tier)**
   - React-based single-page application (SPA)
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Client-side routing and state management
   - RESTful API consumption

2. **Backend Layer (Application Tier)**
   - Django REST Framework API server
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Business logic implementation
   - Background task processing with Celery

3. **Database Layer (Data Tier)**
   - PostgreSQL primary database
   - Redis for caching and sessions
   - File storage for user-uploaded content

### API Architecture

The backend follows RESTful API principles with the following key endpoints:

**Authentication Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/register/` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login/` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout/` - User logout
- `POST /api/auth/token/refresh/` - Token refresh

**User Management Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/users/profile/{id}/` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile/update/` - Update profile
- `GET/POST /api/users/experiences/` - Manage work experience
- `GET/POST /api/users/education/` - Manage education
- `GET/POST /api/users/skills/` - Manage skills

### Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker with the following services:

1. **Web Service**: Django application server
2. **Database Service**: PostgreSQL database
3. **Cache Service**: Redis server
4. **Background Worker**: Celery worker processes

## Database Design

### Entity Relationship Diagram

The database schema is designed to support comprehensive professional networking features. The core entities and their relationships are illustrated in Fig.2.

### Core Database Models

#### User Model
The custom User model extends Django's AbstractBaseUser and includes:
- Basic authentication fields (email, password)
- Profile information (name, headline, summary, location)
- Professional fields (current position, industry, experience level)
- Privacy settings and system fields

#### Experience Model
Tracks user work experience with fields:
- Job title and company information
- Employment dates (start/end, current position flag)
- Location and job description
- Relationship to User (one-to-many)

#### Education Model
Manages educational background:
- School and degree information
- Field of study and graduation years
- Educational description
- Linked to User profile

#### Skill Management
Implemented through multiple models:
- **Skill**: Master list of available skills
- **UserSkill**: Links users to their skills
- **SkillEndorsement**: Tracks skill endorsements between users

### Database Schema Details

**Table 3: Key Database Tables**
| Table Name | Primary Fields | Relationships |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| users | id, email, first_name, last_name, headline | One-to-many with experiences, education |
| user_experiences | id, user_id, title, company, start_date | Many-to-one with users |
| user_education | id, user_id, school, degree, field_of_study | Many-to-one with users |
| skills | id, name | Many-to-many with users through user_skills |
| user_skills | id, user_id, skill_id, endorsement_count | Junction table for users and skills |
